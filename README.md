## For Rails application:

## Configuration

```sh
rails g jpay:install
```

Configure 'config/initializers/jpay.rb':

```ruby
Jpay.configure do |config|

  config.api = "xxxxx" # your jahanpay api
  config.callback_url = "localhost:3000/verify"

end
```

## Rails Example

Payment Request:

```ruby
class PurchaseController < ApplicationController
  ...
  def payment
    ...
    # payment request action
    requeset = Jpay::PaymentRequest.new({
      amount: 100, # must be in toman
      order_id: 1, # your order id
      text: 1, # any description for your order
      # callback_url: 'localhost:3000/verifyProducts' #this is not needed as you already defined callback url in 'config/initializers/jpay.rb'
      # but you can define it for every purchase if you want to have different callbacks for every purchase
    })

    response = request.pay
    response.valid?
    # if response is valid, it returns your jahanpay invoice number (response.invoice).
    # you must redirect_to "http://jahanpay.com/pay_invoice/#{response.invoice}"
    # or you can do as following:
    redirect_to response.url if response.valid?
    # this will redirect user to jahanpay.
  end
end
```
Payment Verification:

```ruby
class PurchaseController < ApplicationController
  ...
  # verify callback action
  def verify
    # jahanpay sends 'authority' code to your callback_url by GET method as 'au' param
    authority_code = params[:au]

    verification = Jpay::PaymentVerification.new({
      amount: 100, # must be equal to request amount
      authority: authority_code
    })

    response = verification.verify

    response.status # return 1 for successful transaction and error number for unsuccessful transaction

    response.message # returns status message

    response.valid? # returns 'true' if transaction is successful
  end

end
```
